- Configurable security settings
- Rate limiting protection
- CSRF protection
- Comprehensive error handling

## Supported File Types

The application supports the following audio file formats:

### File Upload and Audio Recording
- **WAV** - Waveform Audio File Format
  - MIME types: `audio/wav`, `audio/wave`, `audio/x-wav`, `audio/x-pn-wav`, `audio/vnd.wave`
  - File header validation (RIFF header)
  - Maximum size: 2MB (configurable)
- **MP3** - MPEG Audio Layer III
  - MIME types: `audio/mpeg`, `application/octet-stream`
  - Maximum size: 2MB (configurable)

  - Maximum size: 2MB (configurable)
- **WebM** - Web Media Audio

  - Maximum size: 2MB (configurable)

### File Validation
- MIME type verification using PHP's `finfo`
- File header validation for WAV files
- File extension fallback validation
- Size limit enforcement
- Secure file naming with random prefixes

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- Composer for dependencies
- Web server (Apache/Nginx)
- SMTP server for email functionality

## PHP Configuration

### Upload Limits
The application is configured for a maximum file size of **2MB**. To change this limit, update the following PHP settings:

#### Option 1: PHP Configuration File (php.ini)
```ini
; Set maximum file upload size
upload_max_filesize = 10M

; Set maximum POST data size (should be larger than upload_max_filesize)
post_max_size = 12M

; Set maximum number of file uploads
max_file_uploads = 20
```

#### Option 2: .htaccess File (Apache)
```apache
php_value upload_max_filesize 10M
php_value post_max_size 12M
php_value max_file_uploads 20
```

#### Option 3: Runtime Configuration
Add to your PHP script or use `ini_set()`:
```php
ini_set('upload_max_filesize', '10M');
ini_set('post_max_size', '12M');
ini_set('max_file_uploads', '20');
```

### Important Notes
- `post_max_size` should always be larger than `upload_max_filesize`
- Changes to `php.ini` require a web server restart
- `.htaccess` changes take effect immediately
- Runtime configuration must be set before any file upload processing

### Recommended Settings
For most use cases, we recommend:
- **upload_max_filesize**: 10M (10MB)
- **post_max_size**: 12M (12MB)
- **max_file_uploads**: 20

After changing these settings, update the `max_file_size` value in `config.php` to match your `upload_max_filesize` setting.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
composer install
```

3. Configure the application:
   - Copy `config.example.php` to `config.php`
   - Update the configuration settings in `config.php` with your own values

4. Set up the upload directory:
```bash
mkdir uploads
# Set appropriate permissions for your web server user
# Example for Apache (www-data):
# chmod 755 uploads
# chown www-data:www-data uploads
```

5. Configure your web server to point to the project directory

## Configuration

The `config.php` file contains all configurable options. **Do not commit your real `config.php` to version control.**

- Email settings (SMTP)
- Security headers
- File upload settings (including `max_file_size`)
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting
- Error handling

**Important**: The `max_file_size` setting in `config.php` should match your PHP `upload_max_filesize` setting. See [PHP Configuration](#php-configuration) for details on setting upload limits.

## Customer Usage

1. Access the web interface
2. Choose input method:
   - Record audio directly
   - Upload audio file
   - Enter text
3. Fill in required information:
   - Company name

4. Push to the branch
5. Create a Pull Request

## Multi-language Support

Currently supported languages:
- English (ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§)
- Dutch (ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±)

To add a new language:
1. Add translations to `assets/js/languages.js`
2. Add language flag to the language switcher in `index.php`
3. Add translations for error messages in `process.php`

Example language addition:
```javascript
// In assets/js/languages.js
const translations = {
    'fr': {
        'submit': 'Soumettre',
        'recordAudio': 'Enregistrer l\'audio',
        // ... more translations
    }
};
```

```html
<!-- In index.php language switcher -->
<button type="button" data-lang="fr">
    <img src="https://flagcdn.com/24x18/fr.png" alt="FranÃ§ais" title="FranÃ§ais">
</button>
```
